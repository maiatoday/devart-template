## Description
As often happens this project is a remix of older ideas and older projects. I am interested in making the layers of software that surround us a bit more visible. Every word and image we share in a mediated way goes through software. We don't even think about it anymore. There are people and machines who make decisions in these software layers. User experience design tries to give a sense of control to the user.

There are more ideas: My phone can recognises me. Can I make it alter images I post of myself so that it no longer recognises me? Does this mean the code in the Internet which comes across my face will no longer recognise me? Will my friends recognise me then.

To seed this project I will take an [Android app exploration](https://github.com/maiatoday/autoSelfie) which I wrote recently and play with it some more.

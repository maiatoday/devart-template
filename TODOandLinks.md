#### TODO to complete
 * test on old phone
 * do g+ starting portrait
 * update project description

#### TODO stretch
 * Lsystem cog
 * Search terms for status strings


#### DONE
 * ~~add google+ instead or in addition to twitter (no twitter auth crashes)~~
 * ~~make share button be an icon on the actionbar~~
 * ~~alternatively use imagingbook Median Cut Quantizer~~
 * ~~install gapps on genymotion emulator so I can test~~
 * ~~face recognition show~~
 * ~~make the image mutating architecture easier to work with~~
 * ~~why does the app crash on my phone - it's the ci server build one that crashes, but why?~~
 * ~~add blackbox shake~~
 * ~~see what I can get from g+~~

#### TODO before I can put it on play
 * ~~fix the threading issue~~
 * ~~do the signing config in build.gradle~~
 * ~~make some assets for play~~

#### Cogs ideas
 * Lsystem cog
 * make the DotCog dial saturation up or down
 * GlitchCog Rule of thirds
 * GlitchCog and face interaction
 * More eyeCogs
 * DotCog vary Benday dot sizes
 * Search terms for status strings

#### Later ideas
 * renderscript?
 * figure out if I can do the image modifications without opencv. I won't have edge detect
 * look at [colorthief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief/blob/master/js/color-thief.js)

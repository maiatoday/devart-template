TODO
~~add google+ instead or in addition to twitter (no twitter auth crashes)~~
~~make share button be an icon on the actionbar~~
 * figure out if I can do the image modifications without opencv. I won't have edge detect
 * look at [colorthief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief/blob/master/js/color-thief.js)
 * alternatively use imagingbook Median Cut Quantizer
~~install gapps on genymotion emulator so I can test~~
 * g+ info in first image
~~face recognition show~~
 * make the image mutating architecture easier to work with
 * renderscript?
 * why does the app crash on my phone - it's the ci server build one that crashes, but why?

###### Portrait - self portrait
One process: Look, look at the page, draw the portrait - recognise?, mutate, capture
Another process: capture an image, change the pixels, change the pixels, share - capture, mutate, recognise?

###### Now the fun starts
Start looking at the face recognition loop and how to subvert this.
Grab the info I get about the Google+ user and incorporate into the first image.
Expand the intervention algorithms.

###### and the bugs?
 * Navigation flow bugs.
 * Google+ sign in status not shown
 * Remember the previous image if you go elsewhere

###### Copy-Paste-Mutate
I can't remember when last I started a project on a blank page.  It always starts somewhere, say the IDE wizard makes a HelloWorld. Often there are code snippets and nuggets from elsewhere. Android examples from developer.android.com, snippets from stackoverflow. Sometimes I transplant bits of code from other languages and projects. An example of this is glitch code I collaged from [Jakob Penca's processing code]([http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1358257/glitchp5/web/index.html). The result of this that the style varies as my own coding style tends to change depending on where I am coding. Unless it's the android developer examples or stackoverflow, I will attempt to track my sources so I can credit the original authors as I go along.

###### Some thoughts on process
Sometimes the goals are clear at a local level but more opaque at a project level. Sometimes I don't know what I want but I'll recognise it when I see it. Today I have the sense of some tech I want to include in the project for practical purposes. There must be a way to get the images out and on the web. I have twitter integration but my implementation is clunky. I want to try to integrate the g+ apis. The quickstart g+ app is working. Some exploring to see which of the api elements to include.
